# FireStations

** Binary Heap, Graph Algorythims and Dijkstra's algorithm practice **

Output the maximum time it takes for a fire engine to reach the most distant location in a city.

cities.txt
- The first line is the citySize and the number of street-blocks.
- The second line to fifth line contain the coordinates of the four fire stations.
- The sixth line contains the coordinates of the most distant location, and time in seconds to get to it.
- The remaining lines contain the starting x coordinate, starting y coordinate, ending x coordinate, ending y
  coordinate, and speed limit of each street-block. Even though streets are not one way, there is only one entry for each street-block.
- City file names are appended with three numbers: number of tenth of miles on a side of the city, maximum number of streets (not street-blocks), and the seed used for the random number generator.
